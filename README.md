## Discovery-Land-Company Home Page:
-Following the header I plaecd video making visibility as video as the background of header.
-Arranged the the text, images in a row by placing position attributes.
-Applied animation to images defining their **Titles** and their **locations**.
-To achieve animation here we used **JS**file by declaring all the images to slide into an **array** as a **Key:Kalue** pair.
-Animation execution is happening here by implementing addEventListener function.
-To highlight the images in animation used transform attribute whenever we are appling mover over the images.

-Mostly designed using pixels but we can replace using em, rem, etc., as our comfort.
-Here used some border box content data on images using anchor tag to redirect to content pages.

## Discovery-Land-Company Our Worlds and Gallery Pages:
-Here in these pages we have number of images representing the locations for vacations providing by this company.
-The view of this content page is designed using flex direction property by adjusting the margin padding between images.
-Used flex wrap property to view the images from row to row to avoid scrolling page because of large content in row-wise.
